Context

The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 consumer movie reviews to be used for natural language processing.
Sentiment analysis scores are computed, word clouds and top 50 frequent words from both Positive and Negative reviews are generated. 

This is then followed by text-preprocessing: tokenizing reviews into individual tokens, removal of stopwords, lemmatization and text stemming.

Topic modelling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is done on the last step. It reveals that characters/cast played in the movie, their acting, plot storyline are the reasons for either positive or negative movie reviews.
